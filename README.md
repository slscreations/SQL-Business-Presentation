This is a project that I created in Snowflake as a business presentation. The dataset I examined was on seven online retailers and their avergae sales. 
I cleansed the data, then used slicing/dicing, and aggregation techniques in order to present the data to my business partners in a way that showcased to them how their products were doing 
overall. We took a look at what products were doing best, and which products could use a bit more help in the marketing department to help gain sales.
